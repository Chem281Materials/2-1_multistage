# Multi-Stage Docker Deployment of MOPAC

## Task 1

You have previously used Docker to create a deployment image for MOPAC.
**You will now create a new deployment image for MOPAC, with the additional requirement that it must use a multi-stage build process.**

The GitHub repository for MOPAC is available [here](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac). Note that although there are already Docker containers available for MOPAC, yours must conform to the following constraints: (1) it must use the `ubuntu:22.04` image as its base; (2) it must build MOPAC from source, using CMake (the MOPAC documentation in the `README.md` file linked above describes how to build MOPAC using CMake); (3) it must be possible for the end-user to run MOPAC with the following command:

```
docker run --rm -v <volume_options> <image_name> <input_file_name>
```

Follow best practices for container development.
**In addition, the image must be built with a multi-stage build, which should be competently designed to minimize the size of the image.**
You may reuse as much code from your previous MOPAC deployment image as you wish.

To find the Ubuntu package names for software dependencies that you want to install with `apt-get`, you can use the [Ubuntu Packages Search](https://packages.ubuntu.com/).
For packages with short name abbreviations (such as BLAS), you may want to select the “Search on: Descriptions” option and search for the full name of the library.
You can also usually find the information you need through a more general web search.
Pay careful attention to the CMake output; if something goes wrong, it will usually give you a hint regarding what you need to do.
As an example input file, you can use the following (save it into a file with a “`.mop`” extension).
The normal way to run a MOPAC input file is “`mopac <file_name>.mop`”.

## Task 2

Put all of your files (including your Dockerfile, entrypoint script, test input file, etc.) in this GitHub repository.
Create a GitHub Actions workflow in this repository that runs a MOPAC calculation through your image and prints the output from the **host**.

## Task 3

In the Answer section below, provide the size of your previous image, as well as the size of the new multi-stage image.
Unless you had originally used a multi-stage build, you will likely find that the new image is dramatically smaller.

Briefly (in roughly 3-5 sentences) describe the primary reasons for the differences in size - for example, which directories are the primary source of bloat in the larger image?
You don't need to provide an exhaustive description of every difference, but list a few noteworthy specifics.
If your original submission used a multi-stage build, you can simply indicate this fact in liue of a description.

## Answer

Provide your response to Task 3 here.

## Hints

If you understand the lecture material regarding libraries, you will find that this doesn't actually require much effort.
Think carefully about what an executable actually needs at runtime.
